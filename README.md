# Brew Haven - Setup and File Guide\n\nThis repository contains a complete 4-page static website for Brew Haven, a specialty coffee shop. It includes a fully functional client-side shopping cart using localStorage, multiple pages (Home, Menu, About, Contact), and a dedicated Cart page. All styling is done using Tailwind CSS classes, with inline SVG icons and placeholder font tokens for server-side font loading.\n\nWhat’s included:\n- index.html: Home page with hero, storytelling sections, testimonials, and a floating cart drawer.\n- menu.html: Menu with 5+ coffee options and 3 pastries, each with price and description. Add-to-cart buttons are wired to the localStorage cart.\n- about.html: Company story and values with rich, narrative content.\n- contact.html: Contact form and Hyderabad, India placeholder location.\n- cart.html: Dedicated shopping cart page showing cart contents, total, and basic checkout flow.\n- index.html, about.html, menu.html, contact.html share a consistent header, branding, and footer across pages.\n\nHow to run locally:\n1. Save all files in a single directory.\n2. Open index.html in your browser, or serve via a static server (e.g., using Python’s http.server or a Node-based server).\n3. Use the header navigation to browse pages. The cart can be opened via the cart button on desktop and the mobile menu on small screens.\n\nNotes:\n- All images use the placeholder format: src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3912509/pexels-photo-3912509.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940\" as specified, to be replaced by the server with real assets.\n- Fonts are loaded via placeholder tokens: style attribute uses font-family: {{font: Font Name}}; this will be processed by the server.\n- The cart uses localStorage (key: brewHavenCart) and persists across pages.\n- The current year in the footer is 2025.\n
